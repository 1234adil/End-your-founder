# Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done".
# Once "done" is entered, print out the total, and average of the numbers.
# If user enters anything other than a number,
# detect their mistake using try and except, and print
# an error message and skip to the next number.

total = 0  # Initialize total sum
count = 0  # Initialize count of numbers entered
